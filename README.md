Title: Unveiling Sentiments: Analysing Amazon Alexa Product Reviews



I'm thrilled to share a personal project that has consumed a significant chunk of my time lately – diving into the treasure trove of customer reviews for Amazon Alexa products. I embarked on this journey to explore the sentiments expressed by users and uncover insights that often hide within the sea of words.



Problem statement:  Deciphering the Customer Voice



The idea sprouted from a genuine curiosity to understand what users love, dislike, and wish for when it comes to Amazon Alexa products. Armed with a dataset collected from various sources, including the Public Relations team, my mission was to unearth the stories told by the customers through their reviews.



Approach :  A Symphony of Sentiment Analysis and Word Clouds



Sentiment analysis became the heart of my exploration. I wanted to know if the reviews exuded positivity, negativity, or danced in the shades of neutrality. It wasn't just about classifying sentiments but understanding the emotional nuances embedded in the language.



Word Clouds



To make the exploration visually captivating, I decided to craft word clouds. These visualizations allowed me to see the most prominent words in the reviews, providing a glimpse into the collective voice of the customers. It was akin to painting a picture with words – a rich tapestry of opinions and preferences.



Machine learning models: Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression



As I delved into the world of machine learning, I opted for Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression to bring a quantitative edge to my qualitative findings.



Naive Bayes, with its simplicity and efficiency, seemed like the perfect companion for handling the intricacies of text data. It excelled in distinguishing sentiments and sifting through the textual nuances, providing me with a robust foundation for analysis.



The classic Logistic Regression stepped in to offer a balance between performance and interpretability. Its ability to model the probability of sentiments made it an ideal choice. Unveiling the influential features driving sentiment classification became an enlightening part of my exploration.

 

Results: 

The sentiment analysis, word clouds, and machine learning models collectively told a story – a narrative of what users value, what irks them, and the sentiments that echo in their reviews.



In the realm of sentiment prediction, Naive Bayes exhibited a remarkable 96% F1 score for identifying positive reviews. Not to be outdone, Logistic Regression took the lead with an impressive 97% F1 score, solidifying its place as a reliable predictor of positive sentiments (1) and negative sentiments (0).



Conclusion: 

As I wrap up this project, I carry with me a deeper appreciation for the stories that data can tell and the insights that lie beneath the surface.
